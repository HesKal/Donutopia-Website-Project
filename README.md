## 🎨 Design & Planning Process

Before writing a single line of code, our team conducted a thorough planning phase:

1.  **Competitive Analysis:** We evaluated competitor websites like Dunkin' Donuts and Krispy Kreme to understand industry standards and identify opportunities.
2.  **Site Mapping & Wireframing:** We planned the website's structure and the layout of each page to ensure a logical user flow.
3.  **Design Principles:** We applied principles of contrast, alignment, repetition, and proximity to create a clean and cohesive design.
